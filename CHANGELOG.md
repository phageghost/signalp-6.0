# SignalP 6.0 Repository - Fork Changes

This document outlines the key changes made to this forked SignalP 6.0 repository compared to the original repository. These changes were implemented to resolve critical bugs and improve the training stability of the Bert-CRF model.

## üö® Critical Bug Fixes

### 1. CRF Constraint System Removal
**Issue**: The original repository included an experimental CRF constraint system that was not part of the intended SignalP 6.0 architecture described in the paper. This system caused:
- Infinite loss values during training
- Inability to train on sequences that violated hardcoded transition rules
- Fundamental architectural mismatch with the paper's design

**Solution**: Completely removed all CRF constraint logic:
- Removed `--constrain_crf` argument from `train_model.py` and `distill_model.py`
- Removed constraint initialization and application code
- Updated model architecture to learn transitions naturally from training data

**Files Modified**:
- `scripts/train_model.py` - Removed constraint logic and arguments
- `scripts/distill_model.py` - Removed constraint logic and arguments
- `src/signalp6/models/bert_crf.py` - Removed constraint parameters from CRF initialization
- `README.md` - Removed constraint-related examples

### 2. CRF Parameter Initialization Fix
**Issue**: CRF layer parameters (`crf.transitions`) contained NaN values after model loading, causing training failures.

**Solution**: Refactored model loading to avoid CRF initialization issues:
- Create model from scratch instead of using `from_pretrained()`
- Load only BERT weights from pretrained checkpoint
- Ensure CRF layer is properly initialized with random weights

**Files Modified**:
- `scripts/train_model.py` - Complete refactor of model loading logic

### 3. CRF Constraint Mask Device Handling
**Issue**: CRF constraint masks were not properly moved to the correct device (MPS/GPU), causing device mismatch errors.

**Solution**: 
- Changed constraint masks from `torch.nn.Parameter` to regular `torch.Tensor`
- Re-added `to()` method override to explicitly move constraint masks
- Ensured proper device synchronization

**Files Modified**:
- `src/signalp6/models/multi_tag_crf.py` - Fixed constraint mask initialization and device handling

## üîß Training Stability Improvements

### 4. NaN/Inf Loss Detection and Handling
**Issue**: Training would fail with NaN or infinite loss values, often silently.

**Solution**: Added comprehensive NaN/Inf detection throughout training:
- Input validation (data, targets, global_targets)
- Model output validation (loss, probabilities, predictions)
- Gradient validation
- Parameter validation at training start and each epoch
- Automatic batch skipping for problematic batches

**Files Modified**:
- `scripts/train_model.py` - Added `check_model_parameters()` function and extensive validation

### 5. Enhanced Gradient Clipping
**Issue**: Exploding gradients caused training instability.

**Solution**: Implemented more aggressive gradient clipping:
- Reduced default gradient clipping norm from 0.25 to 0.1 for large gradients
- Added gradient norm validation after clipping
- Skip batches with still-too-large gradients

**Files Modified**:
- `scripts/train_model.py` - Enhanced gradient clipping logic

### 6. Learning Rate Management
**Issue**: High learning rates caused numerical instability.

**Solution**: Added automatic learning rate reduction:
- Detect high loss values (>1e4)
- Automatically reduce learning rate by factor of 0.5
- Prevent learning rate from going below 1e-5

**Files Modified**:
- `scripts/train_model.py` - Added adaptive learning rate reduction

## üìä Metrics and Reporting Fixes

### 7. Metrics Array Indexing Fix
**Issue**: `IndexError: too many indices for array` in metrics reporting functions.

**Solution**: Fixed array shape handling in metrics functions:
- Ensure `true_cs` and `pred_cs` are 1-dimensional
- Handle length mismatches between arrays
- Properly apply valid masks for NaN filtering

**Files Modified**:
- `scripts/train_model.py` - Fixed `report_metrics()` and `report_metrics_kingdom_averaged()` functions

### 8. Empty Metrics Handling
**Issue**: Pandas DataFrame creation failed when metrics were empty dictionaries.

**Solution**: Added graceful handling for empty metrics:
- Check if metrics are empty before DataFrame creation
- Log informative message instead of crashing

**Files Modified**:
- `scripts/train_model.py` - Added empty metrics check in final evaluation

## üíæ Model Saving Improvements

### 9. Guaranteed Model Checkpointing
**Issue**: Model was only saved when validation metrics improved, leading to missing checkpoints in short training runs.

**Solution**: Always save final model:
- Save model at end of training regardless of improvement
- Ensure checkpoints are available for final evaluation
- Prevent "no checkpoint found" errors

**Files Modified**:
- `scripts/train_model.py` - Added final model saving logic

## üêõ Linter and Syntax Fixes

### 10. Method Definition Fixes
**Issue**: Linter errors in utility classes.

**Solution**: Fixed method definitions:
- Added missing `self` parameter to `DecoyConfig.update()` method
- Fixed variable assignment issues in training loops

**Files Modified**:
- `scripts/train_model.py` - Fixed method signatures and variable assignments

### 11. OpenMP Conflict Resolution
**Issue**: OpenMP library conflicts on macOS causing crashes.

**Solution**: Added environment variable setting:
- Set `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` at script start
- Prevent OpenMP initialization conflicts

**Files Modified**:
- `scripts/train_model.py` - Added OpenMP conflict resolution

## üîç Debugging and Monitoring

### 12. Verbose Logging System
**Issue**: Limited visibility into training process and debugging information.

**Solution**: Added comprehensive debug logging:
- `--verbose` flag for DEBUG-level logging
- Detailed batch-by-batch information
- Model parameter validation logging
- Training progress monitoring

**Files Modified**:
- `scripts/train_model.py` - Added `setup_logger()` function and extensive debug logging

### 13. Training Data Structure Validation
**Issue**: Limited visibility into data loading and batch structure.

**Solution**: Added data validation logging:
- Dataset type and configuration logging
- Batch size and sampling strategy logging
- Input/output tensor shape and range logging

**Files Modified**:
- `scripts/train_model.py` - Added data validation and logging

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Improvements

### 14. Model Loading Refactor
**Issue**: Complex and error-prone model loading logic.

**Solution**: Simplified and robustified model loading:
- Clear separation of tokenizer and model loading
- Proper vocabulary size handling
- Graceful fallback to random initialization

**Files Modified**:
- `scripts/train_model.py` - Complete refactor of model initialization

### 15. Device Compatibility
**Issue**: Limited device support and potential device mismatch errors.

**Solution**: Enhanced device handling:
- Automatic device detection (CUDA/MPS/CPU)
- Proper tensor device placement
- Device synchronization validation

**Files Modified**:
- `scripts/train_model.py` - Enhanced device handling and validation

## üìù Documentation Updates

### 16. README Updates
**Issue**: Outdated examples and documentation.

- `debug_model_loading.py` - Model loading validation
- `debug_model_internals.py` - Model architecture inspection
- `debug_training_data_structure.py` - Data loading validation

**Files Created**:
